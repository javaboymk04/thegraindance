When I heard that one of my favorite local shoegaze scene was going to do a gig promoting their new album, **and they allowed cameras?** I couldn't skip this opportunity. One tiny problem though. **It's an indoor gig.**

Before we continue, I actually have made the video version before even making this article. Published just a few months ago. So if you rather watch than read, do see the post below.

Otherwise, let's get this read on the road.

## Context matters 📝
I've been listening to this band named Seaside, a local shoegaze indie band based in Jakarta since I was in college. However, I only listen to their single titled **"Giggle and Blush."** That song leans more into dreampop feel such as the likes of Slowdive (even Slowdive feels still mixes shoegaze and dreampop) rather than heavy shoegaze like My Bloody Valentine.

Long story short, their band went into hiatus, got themself some new members, almost a decade later they came up with a new album called **["Same Old Same New.](https://seasideid.bandcamp.com/album/same-old-same-new-3)"**

I've been listening to their single titled ["Foolishly"](https://open.spotify.com/track/51qPTuZRTfBeQ7I33BDBVc?si=e79c460acd6e4d91) but the album takes it to whole another level. It's certainly a mix of both dreampop and shoegaze, but it does lean more heavily on the shoegaze side with twangy and heavy distorted guitar.

## The meat of it all 🎞️
Since they're a pretty local scene, I'm able to just comment on their post and ask if I can brought my camera to the gig, they said yes. So here's my prep
### Gears
- **Pentax MX**
- **SMC Pentax 50mm 1.4**

That's it really, no flash since at that moment I don't have any flash yet. For the film itself, I prep 2 of them

- **Lomography 800**
- **Cyberpunk 800T**

Both are 800 speed films, both are expensive as fuck, and both are capable for shooting in low light situations.

However, by intentionally putting my camera at ISO 1600 and underexposing the films, I asked my lab to push it by +1 (or in other words, to 1600.)

## Result
> Side note: all photos have been edited with Lightroom

The gig started with an opening band [Sharesprings](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6gPibbNGs5xjXfkctQkIW9?si=wqqxainHSUaPWoRsZJ9ktQ) and I got to shooting straight away. As you may can already tell, I'm a nerd and use glasses so shooting indoor with a 50mm lens in at f/1.4 at all times can be pretty difficult. Especially with the fact that f/1.4 has a very shallow depth of field. So of course there's bound to be some misfocus here and there like this one:

    class="ma0 center w-90"

But Lomo 800 produces incredible color reproduction so I managed to snag off some pics like these:

As we're transitioning from Sharespring to Seaside, I managed to snatch some shot where the lighting is almost dark in a way.But after some editing, boy am i glad to snag those pics because it produces rather unique effect (if you can call it that):

And here are some of my favorite pics using Lomography 800:

    class="ma0 center w-90"

After I ran out of exposures, I reloaded my MX with Cyberpunk 800T. Of course a misfocus is part of the charm.

But just like a famous photographer once said:
> "Sharpeness is a bourgeois concept"
> - *Henri Cartier-Bresson*

If you're a meticulous kind of guy, you might've noticed that there's a "T" in the name of the film, and you could already guess that the "T" stands for "Tungsten." So going into this I'm expecting a pretty heavy tungsten on the edges of the light. But check out these 2 snaps:

{{< figure
    src="images/gig_experience/cyberpunk800T/Bersoreria22833-protected-intensity-DEFAULT-V2.jpg"
    alt="Seaside"
    class="ma0 center w-90"
>}}
{{< figure
    src="images/gig_experience/cyberpunk800T/Bersoreria22834-protected-intensity-DEFAULT-V2.jpg"
    alt="Seaside"
    caption="Seaside | Pentax MX | Lomography 800 +1"
    class="ma0 center w-90"
>}}

**The tungsten actually looks more "*diffused.*"** With my limited knowledge, I'm guessing this is due to the pushing process that alters the look of the tungsten.

Now these last 3 shots is my *favorite* from the bunch. It's because I took some risk and used the feature that my MX has but I've never used before: **double exposure.**

It's kinda hard to explain how to do it in the MX since it doesn't have a dedicated DP button but basically.
- You take your shot
- You press and hold the film rewind button at the bottom of the camera
- At the same time, you crank the film advance lever to fool the camera into thinking that it has already advanced in to the next frame
- Shoot your next exposure
- Crank it like normal
- Then take a blank frame by putting a lens cap or cupping the lens cap with your palm

And here are the result:

Yes you've seen the last picture in the cover, don't care, I like it *that* much.

## Bottom line
Don't be afraid to take your camera into some indoor gig in the future, I know I'm not going to. However, do be mindful of your wallet.

Because the price of film has exploded into the orbit these past few years, 800 speed film is the most expensive color film available now. The *cheapest* one is Cyberpunk 800T do to it being a respool of those Kodak cinema film. Lomo 800 & Portra 800 are very expensive but they're widely available in Indonesia, unlike Cinestill 800T. I haven't even mentioned the price of development, my local lab charges extra for pushing so make sure to ask your lab if they're willing to push your film and do they charge extra or not!

If you want to know more about Seaside, I've linked their latest album bandcamp earlier. If you're more streaming kinda dude, you can check also check out their [Spotify.](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7fcJauZr1ZHqpIO2W57kYw?si=m1clwN1BRGy6uZiO1kMgJA)
