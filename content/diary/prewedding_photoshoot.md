I've always wanted to shoot pre-wedding, but also I've been scared to offer my (admitredly amateur) servies. But the opportunity finally came, and here's my story.

## From landscape to intimate ⛰️

If you've visited my [Lomography](https://www.lomography.com/homes/javaboymk03/) profile, you might've noticed that most of my shots consist of a lot of landscape shots such as this one:
{{< figure
    src="images/prewed/Bersoreria20521.jpg"
    alt="Gate of Krisna store in Bali"
    caption="Krisna Oleh-oleh Bali Gate | Pentax MX | Reflx Lab 100D"
    class="ma0 center w-90"
>}}

Or this one (FYI, this was featured in Lomography's Photo of the Day!):
{{< figure
    src="images/prewed/Bersoreria20572.jpg"
    alt="Kecak Dance at Melasti Gate"
    caption="Kecak Dance at Melasti Gate | Pentax MX | Fuji Color 200"
    class="ma0 center w-90"
>}}

Or street photography like this one:
{{< figure
    src="images/prewed/NURUMSCAN_604.jpg"
    alt="Taichan skewer vendor"
    caption="Blok M's Taichan Skewer Vendor | Pentax MX | Fuji Ilford HP5+"
    class="ma0 center w-90"
>}}

So not so much on intimate, subject-as-the-main-focus kind of photography. Until my friend from the office hit me up and said that she wanted to do a pre-wedding with her fiancée.

## I'm scared not gonna lie 😨

As the title says, I'm scared. This is the first time that I'm photographing something more "intimate," not to mention getting paid as well, so there's a pretty hefty amount of pressure.

So I came in prepared with my gears:

- **Pentax MX**
- **Auto Takumar 35mm 3.5**
- **Portra 400** specifally requested by her
- **Evacam 400 flash unit** newest addition to the team

I would love to tell you more about the flash, but honestly there's not much information on the internet regarding this vintage flash. All I know is it's overpriced as hell (bought it for Rp. 150.000 saw the original price tag was Rp.20.000 but maybe i need to factor in inflation), it does it's job, and the GN (guide number) is a slide rather than a table which is handy for me.

{{< figure

    alt="Flash unit"
    class="ma0 center w-90"

I did test out the flash a day before at my friend's Thanksgiving party, which I will cover some time in the future.

We promised to meet at [Suropati Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FVpwXmYwBG8FBJQv5) at around 10 AM.

You might be asking, "why would you use flash during morning hour?" and the answer to that is: During the shot, it's actually pretty overcast. The sun is still shining but the cloud's are pretty thick, so the overall mood was grey rather than warm yellow. The flash helps making the light on the subject more even.

## The result 📸

### Outta the scans
Let's start with the raw straight out of the lab result.
{{< figure
    src="images/prewed/raw/raw_8.jpg"
    alt="Goofy snacking picture"
    caption="Pentax MX | Auto Takumar 35mm | Portra 400"
    class="ma0 center w-90"
>}}

I know this is a goofy picture, but this demonstrates the previous context of flash during daylight. Usually this would result in the subject having their faces darker because the light is coming from background. However, by using flash, I manage to (as best as I can) evenly distribute the light. Which highlights them more rather than highlighting the background (also keep in mind the overcast weather).

This shot also demonstrate the previous point well:
{{< figure
    src="images/prewed/raw/raw_9.jpg"
    alt="Motorbike ride"
    caption="Pentax MX | Auto Takumar 35mm | Portra 400"
    class="ma0 center w-90"
>}}

The headroom is mostly filled with the sky, which if I meter the photos by using the light from the sky, it would surely result in a dark subject. The flash helps me to mitigate that.

### Lightroom to the rescue

You might have noticed that the ***"raw"*** picture looks a bit dull, the color isn't as ***"popping"*** as how a lot of the Portra sample pictures would lead you to believe. This is because a lot of those pictures are edited.

Yes, I was once like you, a ***"purist"*** who doesn't believe that film photos should be edited. However, did you know that photos have been edited since photography became mainstream. Even the great **Ansel Adams** edited his picture. But back in the day, they do it manually in the dark room instead of nowadays where we can edit it digitally using Lightroom. Though there's not a lot of leeway when you compare editing a film scanned photos than a digital photos.

Here are the previous shot edited:
{{< figure
    src="images/prewed/edit/edit_8 .jpg"
    alt="Goofy snacking picture, but edited"
    caption="Pentax MX | Auto Takumar 35mm | Portra 400"
    class="ma0 center w-90"
>}}
{{< figure
    src="images/prewed/edit/edit_9.jpg"
    alt="Motorbike edit"
    caption="Pentax MX | Auto Takumar 35mm | Portra 400"
    class="ma0 center w-90"
>}}

I think it looks better, I dropped the highlight, lift up the shadows, and do a little bit of color correction as best as I can to replicate the signature Portra look.

Here's some of my best picture that has been edited:

### Closure 🎞️

Overall, I enjoy the experience! It was challenging, fun, and my God due to the nature of film photography where I have to use the viewfinder, I did squats a lot which did my hip muscles some leg day.
