My name is Muhammad **Alif** Farchan. Graduated with International Relations degree back in 2023, worked as video editor before and now I'm the branding guy at a Jakarta & London based consulting firm.

Since my significant other introduced me to film photography around 2024, I've been using it as an escapism from this capitalistic hell hole that has been draining my sanity every time I clock in.

## Gear
- **Pentax MX**, my daily driver for photo walks.
  - Pentax 50mm 1.4 (main lens)
  - Auto Takumar 35mm 3.5 (secondary lens, with M42 mount)
  - Pentax-M 80-200mm f4.5
  - Pentax 28mm but barely used due to mechanical issue and messed up coating
- **Fuji DL-25 Date**, for those quick snap during happy moments.
- **Seagull 4A-107**, My first foray into the world of medium format (currently at the hospital for repairs)

If you want to work with me, please don't hesitate to [contact me!](mailto:alif4chan@gmail.com)

Enjoy your time and have a great day!
