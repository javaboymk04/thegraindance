Welcome, I'm sure that you're not finding this from google or something because I haven't put any SEO in this website (at the time of writing) but if you do. Welcome!

## Reintroduction 👋
My name is Alif, also going with javaboymk03. I'm a hobbyist film photography that works somewhere in Jakarta, Indonesia.

### Gears 📸
Currently, my gear are as follows:
- **Pentax MX:** My go to gear, the one i used the most.

    class="ma0 center w-90"

- **Fuji DL-25 Date:** Secondary option, usually for parties or gatherings

    class="ma0 center w-90"
>}}

- **Seagull 4A:** Newest addition to the gang, why I chose this over Rolleiflex or any other TLR will be discussed in the future.

### Why do I do this? 🤔
Honestly? There's more to just *T3h V1b3zZzzZ!!11!* It's more of my way to escape this Techno-ditatorship-buncha words indicating dystopia hellscape. It forces me to slow down and learn the fundamentals of photography without any digital crutches. Will be discussed in the future as well.

I also created this website as an output for myself to talk about things that I like, don't like, and opinions. So it's not *strictly* going to be about film photography and cameras but mainly I'd talk about that stuff

### Bottom line.

This is a personal passion project, you can find all my yappings and whatnot sorted by categories on the top right.

But in all seriousness. I **do** hope you enjoy your time visiting my site. Here's to film not dying! 🍻

You can find me in other places by clicking the link(s) in the top right corner.

I'm currently not setting up comments on my post due to privacy issue (Disqus), requiring money (Commento), or needing a GitHub account (Giscus and Utterance). So if you want to say something about my works, **please contact me [via email.](mailto:alif4chan@gmail.com)**
